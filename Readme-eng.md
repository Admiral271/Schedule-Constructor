## :alarm_clock: **Constructor capabilities**

**Schedule Constructor** is designed to support educational organizations. We offer a free and convenient program that will facilitate the creation of a schedule and help with its filling.

The constructor has implemented filling, editing, and deleting disciplines, groups, schedules. Our program also facilitates routine activities and speeds them up: you no longer need to fill out each week separately, just use the templates you created for quick transfer of academic disciplines to the schedule. Choose the desired mode of schedule compilation (For the day, for the week or for the semester).

Work on improving the **Schedule Constructor** is ongoing to this day, we are constantly developing and improving the program for better interaction with it! :smiley:

<br/>

## :bangbang: **First launch** :bangbang:

Before starting, make sure that you have the Visual Studio program installed, as well as its necessary components: ASP .NET and web application development, Classic .NET application development, Data storage and processing.

To start working with the application, you need to open the **Schedule-Constructor.sln** file using Visual Studio.
Next, in the **"Project"** tab, select **"Manage NuGet Packages"** and download updates for packages if any.
After that, you need to go to the Package Manager Console and execute several commands:

```

```

## :newspaper: **Filling in data**

Schedule Constructor works with the data you provide. Therefore, before creating a schedule, it is necessary to fill in academic disciplines and groups.

The program has implemented convenient data filling, as well as their editing and filling. The constructor will help avoid errors when filling them out, and if they do happen, it will notify you of them.

## :computer: **System requirements**
